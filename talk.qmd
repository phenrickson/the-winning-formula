When someone tells me, "I want to learn about data science", I've come to realize that there are generally two different mentalities:

. . .

1) *I want to learn the **one-cool-trick** from an open source data science package that I can implement in my project with little to no effort that **will look impressive** to my higher ups who will have next to no idea what I'm talking about but will praise me for using something they can call **AI**.*

. . .

2) *Tell me where to begin on the **dark and unending path** into statistics, mathematics, and programming for the purpose of **learning from data** in order to draw uncertain inferences about data-generating processes at work in the world so that I might better **understand why things happen**.*

To be clear, I don't believe that I can pack [semesters worth of info]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"} into twenty minutes. 

. . .

I think the best I can reasonably do is [spark some level of interest]{.bg style="--col: #FF6F40"} in what I do and why you might find it kind of interesting. Even if it will be hard.

I will point you towards some resources I think you should check out.

. . .

I will recommend a basic technology stack.

. . .

I will list a few books I think you should read (and yes, some are textbooks).

. . .

But, in the end, none of that is really important.

. . .

The most important thing about getting into data science is a **mentality**.

. . .

So first, **I want to tell you a story**.

# 1) Charles Reep and the <br> Desolation of English Football

Or, the importance of research design

---

I recently took a trip to England/Scotland/Ireland and attended a football (read: soccer) match.

. . .

To prepare for this, I did what anyone would do: [I read a 500 page book on the history of soccer tactics and formations.[^1]]{.fragment}

[^1]: I'm also trying to figure out the optimal formation to get my team out of Bronze in Rematch.

This book contained the story of the first ever data-driven insight into the sport of soccer by a man named Charles Reep.

## {background-image="images/charles-reep.jpg" style="color: white;"}

---

In 1950, Charles Reep was an RAF officer stationed in Bushy Park, England.

. . .

A devoted football fan, he had been appointed director of football teams for the RAF and obsessively sought ways to improve his teams.

. . . 

While attending a football match between Swindon and Bristol Rovers on March 18, 1950, he became fed up after watching attack after attack produce no goals.  

. . .

Putting pen to paper, he decided to record all 147 attacking sequences by Swindon in the second half, which produced one goal in a 1-0 victory.

. . . 

In other words, their rate of failure in attacking was >99%.

---

<!-- > Reep, extrapolating this, and assuming 280 attacks per game and an average of two goals scored, realized this equated to a failure rate of 99.29 percent, which meant that **an improvement of only 0.71 percent was necessary for a side to average three goals a game.**[^2]

[^2]: *Inverting the Pyramid*. 2025. Jonathan Wilson. Page 166.

. . . -->

Charles Reep sought to understand how to improve a soccer team's ability to generate goals.

. . .

He developed increasingly elaborate (handwritten) methods for recording and analyzing the events within games.

## {background-image="images/charles-reep-notes.jpg" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

## {background-image="images/charles-reep-notes-1966.png" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

---

Reep wanted to know **when goals occur**, so he looked at all of the sequences of passes that resulted in goals. After recording hundreds of games, he observed:

. . .

> Only two goals out of nine came from [sequences] which included more than three received passes.â€™

. . .

Stated another way, **~80% of goals** came from passing sequences with **three passes or less**.

## {background-image="figures/goals_distribution_uniform.png" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

---

Reap's data collection produced what was arguably the first-ever analytical insight into sport: goals tended to occur from shorter sequences of passes.

. . .

**The key to scoring goals and winning matches**, therefore, was simple: [greduce passes and possession time in favor of getting the ball downfield as quickly as possible]{.bg style="--col: #FF6F40"}.

## {background-image="images/royal-statistical-society.png" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

---

The teams he oversaw at the RAF implemented his strategies and saw tremendous success. 

. . .

Two smaller teams, Watford and Wimbledon, came to embrace his recommendations for "direct" football and managed to achieve a series of promotions.

. . .

Charles Reap later published his findings in the Royal Statistical Society.

## {background-image="images/royal-statistical-society.png" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

---

So, why am I telling you about this? 

. . .

Charles Reep followed all of the steps I would expect you to follow in learning about data science:

- He collected data.\
- He found a pattern.\
- He used this pattern to recommend a strategy.\
- The teams that followed his strategy achieved success.

---

England, the originator of the world's most popular sport, eventually embraced this approach. The long-ball became England's football orthodox.

. . .

And it ultimately proved to be a disaster.

. . .

Because Reep's insight about soccer was fundamentally wrong.

---

Reep observed that **~80%` of goals** came from passing sequences with **three passes or less**..

But he also observed that **~90%` of all passing sequences** had **three passes or less**.

. . .

Meaning, there are a lot of short passing sequences in soccer that **don't** lead to goals.

## {background-image="figures/goal_distribution_actual.png" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

---



He should have been examining **all passing sequences** and asking, when do goals occur?

<!-- ---

In other words, Reep solved for this:

. . .

$$
max_k \Pr(\text{Passes} = k \mid \text{Goal}) \text{ for all sequences of $k$ passes} \newline
\textnormal{ie, what is the most common number of passes when a goal has been scored?}
$$

. . .

instead of this:

$$
\Pr(\text{Goal} \mid \text{Passes} = k) \newline
\textnormal{ie, what is the probability of a goal among all sequences with $k$ passes?}
$$

--- -->

He would have noticed that goals are more likely to come from longer sequences of passes.

## {background-image="figures/hughes-2005-figure.png" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

---

So what happened? Charles Hughes embraced Reap's methods and ultimately became England's director of football in 1983.

His book, *The Winning Formula*, advocated against passing and possession in favor of booting the ball upfield and shooting at the first opportunity.

. . .

These policies become the orthodox of English football and set the direction of English football development for over a decade.

## {background-image="images/the-winning-formula-british-aerospace.png" style="color: white;" background-size="contain"}

---

Hughes was removed from his job in 1994 when England failed to qualify for the World Cup. 

. . .

England still has not won a major international tournament since 1966.

> It is, frankly, horrifying that a philosophy founded on such basic misinterpretation of figures could have been allowed to become a cornerstone of English coaching. **Anti-intellectualism is one thing, but faith in wrong-headed pseudo intellectualism is far worse.**[^3]

So, why am I telling you about this?

. . .

At this point, you might very reasonably be wondering:

. . .

How does any of this apply to to my job in Network/Security?

. . .


What if I was to tell you that the same methods used to study soccer games are being used in network/security?

# 2) But How Does Any of This <br> Apply to Your Job in Network/Security?

---

You can throw a dart out the window and hit a vendor that is talking about their newfound capabilities with **AI**.

What if I was to tell you that the same methods used to study soccer games are the same techniques being labelled as AI?

Look it pains me to say this, but ![](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png){width=200px}

I am writing some text, and here is the Python logo inline

For my own work setup, I use `VSCode` with extensions for interacting with data

There is no one-simple-trick; there is no tool that you can buy and start solving all of your problems.

. . .

The value in (data) science usually doesn't come from algorithms, tools, platforms.

. . .

The value in (data) science is usually from the [creativity/dedication/passion]{.fg style="--col: #75BAFF"} of asking questions and being willing to go to the ends of the earth in search of the answer.
