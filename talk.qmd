# Context {.large-slide}

## 

I am often asked, 

## {.large-slide}

<br>
"I don't like math, statistics, or programming.

<div style="height: 28px;"></div>
How do I be a data scientist?"

## {.large-slide background-image="images/alec-baldwin.jpg" style="color: white;"}

"I don't like math, statistics, or programming.

<div style="height: 28px;"></div>
How do I be a data scientist?"

## {.large-slide background-image="images/alec-baldwin.jpg"}

When someone tells me, "I want to learn about data science", I've come to realize that there are generally two different mentalities:

. . .

1) *I want to learn the **one-cool-trick** from an open source data science package that I can implement in my project with little to no effort that **will look impressive** to my higher ups who will have next to no idea what I'm talking about but will praise me for using something they can call **AI**.*

. . .

2) *Tell me where to begin on the **dark and unending path** into statistics, mathematics, and programming for the purpose of **learning from data** in order to draw uncertain inferences about data-generating processes at work in the world so that I might better **understand why things happen**.*

I will point you in the direction I think you should go.

. . .

I will recommend a basic technology stack.

. . .

I will list a few books to check out (and yes, some are textbooks).

. . .

But none of that is really important.

. . .

Because first, I want to tell you a story.

# 1) Charles Reep and the <br> Desolation of English Football

Or, the importance of research design

At this point, you might very reasonably be wondering:

. . .

How does any of this apply to to my job in Network/Security?

# 2) But How Does Any of This <br> Apply to Your Job in Network/Security?

. . .

Hold on to your butts.

# 3) Okay, So What Should I Do?
